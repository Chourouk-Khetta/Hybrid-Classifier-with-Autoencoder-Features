# Hybrid-Classifier-with-Autoencoder-Features
The aim is to compare two hybrid classifiers—Autoencoder+GMM and Autoencoder+PW—on the Wine dataset. An autoencoder extracts features, then GMM and PW classify using Bayes rule. Performance is tested via 5-fold CV, varying Gaussian components, GMM inits, and PW bandwidth   h, comparing their error rates.
